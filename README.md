# ChatBotKit Next.js Primer

This is a [ChatBotKit](https://chatbotkit.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped project. It is a simple example demonstrating how to build your advanced conversational AI chatbots on top of ChatBotKit.

This example is designed to be as simple as possible and act as a primer. No specific styles and other functionalities are available apart from managing the basic conversation flow. The code can easily be extended to create a custom, advanced AI chatbot.

## Getting Started

Create a file called `env.local` and add your [ChatBotKit Token](https://chatbotkit.com/tokens) like this:

```
CHATBOTKIT_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN HERE>
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start the chatbot.
